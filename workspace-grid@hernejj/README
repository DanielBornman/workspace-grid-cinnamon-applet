Description
-------------
This is a Cinnamon applet that implements a 2D workspace grid and provides a
workspace switcher that understands multiple rows.  In addition, the standard
keyboard shortcuts for workspace up/down navigation are modified to actually
switch workspaces instead of bringing up the Cinnamon Workspace Expo and
Overview.

Compatibility
--------------
This applet has been tested to be compatible with the following versions of
Cinnamon and Linux distributions:
    Linux Mint 13 - Cinnamon 1.4.0
    Ubuntu 12.04  - Cinnamon 1.6.7
    Ubuntu 12.10  - Cinnamon 1.6.7

Installing
-----------
1. Place the "workspace-grid@hernejj" folder in the 
   ".local/share/cinnamon/applets" folder in your home directory.

2. Restart Cinnamon either by using Alt+F2, then hit 'r' then the enter key. Or
   simply log out and log back in.

3. Start the "Cinnamon Settings" program, go to the Applets section and look
   for the entry named "Workspace grid (2D) and switcher".  Check the checkbox
   to the left of this entry to enable this applet.

Setting the Number of Workspaces
--------------------------------
This applet allows you to configure the number or rows and columns in your
workspace grid.  Just right click on the applet and a dialog will appear.
Enter the number of columns and rows you want and press the enter key.

Navigating
-----------
You can navigate between your workspaces using the standard system keyboard
shortcuts.  By default they are as listed:

    switch-to-workspace-up      Ctrl+Alt+Up_Arrow
    switch-to-workspace-down    Ctrl+Alt+Down_Arrow
    switch-to-workspace-left    Ctrl+Alt+Left_Arrow
    switch-to-workspace-right   Ctrl+Alt+Right_Arrow
    
You can also click on the workspace or the row indicator lines within the
switcher to navigate directly to a specific workspace or row.

You can also place your mouse over the switcher and use the scroll wheel to
navigate forward and backward in the workspace grid.

    - Added key binding support for Linux Mint 13 & Cinnamon 1.4.0.
